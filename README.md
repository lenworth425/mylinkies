# mylinkies

## Basic Overview

mylinkies is a severAPI that will be used for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The serverAPI uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, it uses  the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.connects to the server database using MongoDB. 

## API Usage

The mylinkies uses two models, and two schemas, with one of the models havibg a submodel called the reaction:
    
### Models
